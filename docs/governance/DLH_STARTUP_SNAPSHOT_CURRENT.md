# Deep Learning + HANK Startup Snapshot — CURRENT

Date: 2026-09-13

Repository: `zcx369658780/deep-learning-hank`

Local Owner-designated workspace: `D:\deep-learning-hank`

## Governance state

- live GitHub `main` = synchronized repository/code/governance authority;
- open GitHub Issue = sole DSH Builder task authority only after publication + CURRENT synchronization + authoritative activation comments;
- DSH = bounded Builder/scientific analyst only under an active Issue;
- ChatGPT = independent reviewer / scientific-route advisor / task issuer / governance operator;
- Owner = final scientific authority;
- Builder completion is not acceptance.

Priority:

`Scientific correctness > Experiment reproducibility > Research iteration speed > Git auditability > Documentation completeness`

## Current Builder state

**NO ACTIVE BUILDER ISSUE.** The two tested stabilization routes are both CLOSED
with negative (Terminal-C) evidence on the frozen central selected-Q case:
- Issue #60 / DLH-5V-L value-update damping (accepted Terminal C);
- Issue #61 / DLH-5V-M adaptive pseudo-time/resolvent (accepted Terminal C).

Next scientific route: **OWNER / ChatGPT SCIENTIFIC DESIGN REQUIRED**. A successor
issue is **NOT YET AUTHORIZED**; no Builder branch or scientific execution may start
before a new authorized Issue.

## Latest accepted gate — Issue #61 / DLH-5V-M

Issue #61 is CLOSED completed at Terminal C.

Accepted candidate / integration:

Reviewer acceptance:

`5651495744`

Acceptance integration:

`5651496951`

Accepted verdict:

`DLH_5VM_ACCEPTED__TERMINAL_C_CONFIRMED__ADAPTIVE_RESOLVENT_LADDER_EXHAUSTED_ON_FROZEN_CENTRAL_TRAJECTORY__ROUTE_RECONSIDERATION_REQUIRED`

Accepted terminal:

`DLH_5VM_ADAPTIVE_RESOLVENT__NO_VIABLE_EFFECTIVE_DOMAIN_RESOLVENT_STEP__ROUTE_RECONSIDERATION_REQUIRED`

Accepted interpretation (trajectory-bounded):

- the adaptive pseudo-time/resolvent route accepted 2 positive-domain iterations on the frozen central trajectory;
- at the third update request every authorized delta on the ladder {1000·2^-k, k=0..20} is infeasible (the smallest-delta limiting failure is at F3 (13,13), z=1);
- this does NOT prove global nonexistence or uniqueness of a positive-domain HJB fixed point;
- it does NOT exclude another basin, a continuation/homotopy path, or another fixed-point-preserving operator;
- the R1 fail-closed non-finite-boundary handling is part of the accepted implementation;
- together with Issue #60 value damping, the two tested stabilization routes are BOTH negative evidence on the frozen central selected-Q case.

## Prior accepted gate — Issue #60 / DLH-5V-L

Issue #60 is CLOSED completed at Terminal C.

Accepted candidate / integration:

`9b1538feabe2cc4634653721e725ee3e46d449bb`

Reviewer acceptance:

`5650057012`

Acceptance integration:

`5650059195`

Accepted verdict:

`DLH_5VL_ACCEPTED__TERMINAL_C_CONFIRMED__VALUE_UPDATE_ONLY_INVARIANT_SAFEGUARD_FAILS_ON_FROZEN_CENTRAL_TRAJECTORY__RAW_OPERATOR_ROUTE_RECONSIDERATION_REQUIRED`

Accepted interpretation:

- pure value-update damping preserves the positive-`p_b` domain for a short path but is not a viable convergence route on the frozen central trajectory;
- 17 accepted iterations remain in-domain, then no authorized dyadic value-damping step exists;
- this is trajectory-bounded evidence only and does NOT prove global nonexistence of a positive-domain HJB fixed point;
- external-price sensitivity from Issue #59 remains real but does not resolve the selected-Q invariant-domain problem.

## Frozen household / same-process authority

Accepted household oracle remains immutable/read-only:

`src/deep_learning_hank/two_asset/matlab_faithful_two_asset_ha.py`

Git blob:

`76ae5b149993a7edeeb8eb337f1b02b3fe33c51e`

Accepted selected-Q source remains immutable/read-only:

`src/deep_learning_hank/two_asset/boundary_hjb_selected_q.py`

Git blob:

`7ea342ccbe15d852b90743b14bb4b02977c2d78b`

```text
HJB boundary policy <=> KFE boundary transition law
Q backward
future KFE exactly Q^T
Q_ij>=0 for i!=j
Q_ii=-sum of ACTUAL represented outgoing rates
Q1=0 by construction
same selected candidate/rates for HJB and future KFE
```

Pinning/normalization may never repair leakage.

Stationary KFE remains **NOT AUTHORIZED**.

## Interpretation ceiling

No continuation/homotopy, no new delta / price / grid / margin / damping
experiments, no KFE/stationary KFE, no SCC/global-Q, no production Wmax/
resolution, no GE/multi-region/neural/nominal/calibration/policy/welfare/Results,
and no successor Issue may start before an Owner/ChatGPT scientific design and a
new authorized Issue.
